Our test inputs have only 4 and 16 integers, respectively.  We need a much larger array to even keep the GPU busy.\n","  * **Our calculation is too simple**: Sending a calculation to the GPU involves quite a bit of overhead compared to calling a function on the CPU.

In those cases, it makes sense to send data to the GPU and keep it there until all of our processing is complete.\n","  * **Our data types are larger than necessary**: Our example uses `int64` when we probably don't need it.  Scalar code using data types that are 32 and 64-bit run basically the same speed on the CPU, but 64-bit data types have a significant performance cost on the GPU.  Basic arithmetic on 64-bit floats can be anywhere from 2x (Pascal-architecture Tesla) to 24x (Maxwell-architecture GeForce) slower than 32-bit floats.
